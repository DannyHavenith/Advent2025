My Advent of Code 2025 solutions
===============================

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming
challenges. My personal goal is to write solutions with the lowest big-O time
complexity possible for each problem, with a secondary goal of writing the least
amount of code to achieve that.

The performance goal is mainly reached by avoiding brute-force solutions even if
the problems posed have small input sizes.

I might abandon any of these goals if I get desperate...

All solutions are written in C++ and so far each solution runs in about 5ms on
my machine.
